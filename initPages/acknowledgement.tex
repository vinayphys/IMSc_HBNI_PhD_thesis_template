It gives me immense pleasure to mention here the people who have made my personal and academic journey very memorable and joyful. Whenever I will return back to this page, I will definitely remember the people listed here and the various incidents associated with them.

I will start with a mention of my PhD advisor Professor Pinaki Chaudhuri, because he is the person who took his responsibilities very seriously and that is why I am writing this thesis happily. When I look back myself, what I was seven years before, the positive difference I find is mainly due to him. I never felt Pinaki is my mentor, rather we always discussed like friends. I could always say to him anything, whatever came to my mind without any hesitation. I still remember, when I came to IMSc for the interview, Pinaki was also in the interview panel and he asked me a question from thermodynamics which I could not answer correctly. Later he taught us a course on Statistical mechanics in the second semester where he gave some numerical exercises which pushed me to explore more on computer simulations. Then I approached him after the semester during the summer break and asked him to give me some tasks so that I could have some idea about the type of research that he does. Then he asked me to write an MD code to simulate Linnard-Jones system. With this, my journey with computer simulations started which I am still continuing with full passion. When I started working with him, there was no one in the group, I found very hard to discuss with anyone in the institute. I convinced myself that I was alone and I would have to do everything from scratch. But the best part was that I could enter Pinaki's office anytime. Pinaki not only taught me to solve research problems but also guided to communicate this. He always discussed if I am presenting a poster or giving a talk, and also shared tips and tricks for lucid presentation.

A significant part of the works presented in this thesis has been carried out in collaboration with Professor J\"urgen Horbach at University of D\"usseldorf, Germany. His deep experience has been quite helpful for my research. J\"urgen's strict criteria and standards can be sometimes irritating but always in the end it gives complete satisfaction. My numerous interactions with him, online or in person, have always been wonderful experiences. In particular, my one month visit to D\"usseldorf during April-May 2022, was very fruitful. J\"urgen is not only an extraordinary researcher but also a very interesting personality, always full of joy and fun. I am sure, we will continue our relationship for many more years.

I am highly indebted to DC members Gautam Menon, R. Rajesh, Satyavani Vemparala, and C M Chandrasekhar, who patiently heard my research work during the several DC meetings and provided useful comments which improved the quality of my work and my presentation style as well. Many academic and non-academic discussions with S. R. Hassan, Prusattam Ray, and Areejit Samal have been very useful at different points.

The group meetings in which our group members (Arjun, Projesh, Sayantan, Suman, Umang) and myself discussed many research topics, were a wonderful experience, also provided me an opportunity to learn and discuss some aspects other than the main research theme that we are working on. In several discussion meetings, that we organized, where we very much enjoyed the presentations by Rajesh, Rishu, Garima, Tanmay, Kamal, Devanand, Chandrashekar, Chandrani, Pavitra, Sreevidya, and others, on topics like stochastic thermodynamics, developmental biology, machine learning, etc.

The 2015 IPhD batch to which I belong includes Ankit, Anupam, Arindam, and Soumya. Later in the third semester, the 2016 PhD batch (Ajjath, Pooja, Sabiar, Shivani, Semanti, Sujoy, Vigneshwaran) joined us. These were extremely brilliant colleagues, I really enjoyed attending courses with them. 

I got several friends here: Rajesh, Dhruv, Kamal, Pritam, Rishu, Ekta, Dheeraj, Nitin bhaiya, Vivek bhaiya, Mamta didi, Ankit bhai, Vivek, Shabbir, Mrigendra, Gaurav, Shivam, Prabhat, Amir, Surabhi, Chandrani, Pavitra, Sreevidya, Bodhayan, Sahil, Raghvendra, Amit, Himanshu, Subashri, Nishant, Neelam, Hitesh, Vaibhav, Ravi etc. I can remember numerous instances when we laughed together, making fun of each other and also others. I spent most of my time in F-2 in the main building. Although, I had to spend more than a year at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, I would like to talk about two more friends who deserve special mention. First is Suman, I don't know, how many hours we have talked over the phone about various things. We have discussed Physics, politics, personal stuff, academia, and many more. Being a senior, Suman has always suggested the right direction. He is the person, with whom I could talk about my frustrations. Now, the second one is Shikha, who has also been a senior and taught me numerous computational tips. We have discussed long enough about various problems in the Granular system that made me interested in this field. I would like to pursue this in the future if I get a chance.

IMSc is an excellent institute with world-class facilities, which provides a smooth research environment. In particular, I have been a heavy user of high-performance computing facilities here. I would like to acknowledge Mangal, Vasan, GS, and Ravi for maintaining this and solving instantly the various problems I raised. Administrative staffs including R. Indra, Vishnu Prasad, Baskaran, Babu, K P Shankar, etc. have been quite helpful. I have been part of OLIC for many years where the interactions with K Srinivas, Saket Saurabh, V. Arvind, Archana Shukla, and others, helped me to learn various aspects.

After COVID when I returned back to Chennai, I got a flat in Pallavaram where I got many friends including Shaily, Praveen, Subhadeep, Akriti, Rohit, Jetin, Pratik, Disha, Dibyajyoti, Sameema, Sayani, Nayana, Sameera, etc. We went to watch movies together and also visited several places nearby Chennai. We celebrated festivals together and organized many parties as well. 

I have visited Bangalore several times during my PhD where meeting friends like Prashant, Sukanya, Narendra, Rajendra, etc. was always joyful. During the visit to G\"ottinen, interaction with Prof. Peter Sollich and Rituparno Mandal and with Anoop at D\"usseldorf was very helpful. Also, the help extended by Ajjath during my visit to Paris made my life easier.

I would like to acknowledge my teachers during intermediate Avinash Pathak, Saurabh Kumar, and Piyush Kant who taught the basics of the subject with full dedication. The guidance received by Sanjay Gupta, and N. Nayak during my bachelor's was extremely helpful.

At last, I would like to acknowledge my family members, mummy, papa, brothers (Naveen and Golu), dadi, and my lovely wife Rakhi, for their patience, belief, and support. I can never forget the financial struggles that my parents and brothers faced at a point for the continuation of my studies.
